# Customer Purchase Intent Prediction  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project focuses on predicting the **purchase intent of online shoppers** using a year-long dataset of session data. The aim was to analyze customer interactions and build machine learning models that can accurately classify whether a user is likely to make a purchase.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  
- Explore and preprocess **e-commerce session data**.  
- Identify browsing patterns and behaviors that correlate with purchases.  
- Build and evaluate machine learning models for purchase prediction.  
- Derive actionable insights to help optimize marketing strategies and improve conversion rates.  

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset  
- **Files:**  
  - `data-train.csv` â€“ training dataset with labeled outcomes  
  - `data-test.csv` â€“ test dataset for model evaluation  
- **Target Variable:** Whether the user made a purchase (`1`) or not (`0`).  
- **Challenges:** Dataset included noisy and inconsistent columns, requiring careful cleaning and feature selection.  

## ðŸ“Š Analysis Approach  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** â€“ handled missing values, standardized data, and removed inconsistencies.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ explored browsing behavior patterns.  
3. **Feature Engineering** â€“ created meaningful features to strengthen model performance.  
4. **Model Building** â€“ implemented classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.).  
5. **Evaluation** â€“ compared models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC.  

## ðŸ“ˆ Results and Performance  
- Best-performing model achieved **~78% accuracy** in predicting customer purchase intent.  
- Analysis revealed that factors such as **session activity, visit frequency, and engagement levels** were key drivers of conversion.  

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack  
- **Python** â€“ core development  
- **Pandas, NumPy** â€“ data preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** â€“ visualization  
- **Scikit-learn, XGBoost** â€“ modeling & evaluation
